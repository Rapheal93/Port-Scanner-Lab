# Port Scanner Lab

## Objective

This simple port scanner tool serves as a foundational project for learning about network protocols, socket programming, and cybersecurity principles like port scanning and network reconnaissance. You can expand upon this basic implementation by adding features such as multi-threading for faster scanning, banner grabbing to identify services running on open ports, and error handling for robustness.

### Skills Learned

- Solid understanding of network protocols and socket programming.
- Ability to program in python language.
- Understanding of TCP/IP fundamentals and security concepts.
- Great project management techniques.  

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Python IDE.
- Notepad.
